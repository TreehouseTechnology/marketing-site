## Adding a new team member

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in `team/` named `{firstName}-{lastName}.mdx`
2. Add a markdown comment at the top of the page with `name` and `role`:

    ```markdown
    ---
    name: Firstname Lastname
    role: Software Engineer
    ---
    ```

3. All remaining content should be the team members desired description. All markdown tags are encouraged.
