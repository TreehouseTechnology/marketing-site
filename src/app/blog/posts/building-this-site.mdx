summary: "How we built this site in a day."

Many businesses benefit with a digital presence, whether that be an app for providing a service, or a website for delivering information to customers.
Being a software development consultancy, Treehouse is no different. We wanted a site to provide information to potential and existing customers, showcase
past and present projects, and generate leads (or even just conversation!) for potential customers, and engineers or designers interested in joining the team.

Given that we are a small team of 1 (I also think it's weird to keep typing 'we'), it was in our interest to move quickly and use what frameworks and
templates we could find to deliver a site that met our needs, while also being able to showcase and highlight our development practices.

## TLDR;

We needed a site, fast. We leveraged as many OSS templates and frameworks as we could to get up-and-running, while still allowing for flexible development
for new features going forward.

An interesting bit that appeared during development was the ability to showcase how to utilize
route handlers in a typesafe way via patterns, and also showcase a cool feature of Next.js: server actions.
