# Product page

## Adding a new product

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in `listings/` named `{product}.mdx`
2. Add a markdown comment at the top of the page with `title` and `link`, and `linkText`:

    ```markdown
    ---
    title: Product Name
    link: https://example.com
    linkTitle: sign up
    ---
    ```

3. All remaining content should be the product description. All markdown tags are encouraged.
