FTR Events is a simracing league on iRacing. The league was 
running most of it's operations out of a Discord server, supplemented by
Discord bots and spreadsheets.  

The app is developed using Next.js, hosted on AWS EC2. It has authentication powered
by Auth.js and DynamoDB. The back-end is MySQL. It provides user registration, driver profile
management, team creation and management, event registration, series registration, and admin
functionalities so the FTR Events team can focus on the racing instead of series and event
administration.
